# CS138: Distributed Systems

Notes to the CS138: Distributed Systems course by Professor Lindsey Kruper at UCSC. The videos are available on [YouTube](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNPUF5QyWU8PydLG2cIJrCvnn5I_exhYx).

I don't expect anyone to be able to read these notes because of the handwriting. Overall, I throughly enjoyed this course, and will be looking to complete the assignments of CS1380 by Brown, or MIT 6.824 in the next few weeks.
